# Thrower
 
The creature is a one-armed thrower that throws a cube across the screen.
The fitness function is tied to the cube that is flung, based on the -y position.
Each new iteration changes the weights of the joints of the arm, finding the best rotation for the arm to throw the cube.
The search file will run the parallel hill climber 10 times with 10 different populations and show the best one on screen.
